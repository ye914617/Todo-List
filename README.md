## Express and Mongoose<br>

I used express and mongoose to build this web because these frameworks are the most recent trends in web developing. Besides that, I use ejs to transfer 'props' from backend to frontend. Since this is my first backend website, it is just a simple app with basic CRUD function, but of course it do have RWD, try it on phone~

## Thank you
